            <p>Soft surfboards, also known as foam surfboards, are surfboards that are made from foam materials such as polyurethane or expanded polystyrene. They are typically used as beginner surfboards because they are more forgiving and less dangerous than traditional surfboards made of hard materials like fiberglass or epoxy.</p>

                Longboard surfboards, also known as paddleboards, are surfboards that are typically longer and wider than traditional shortboards. They are more stable and easier to ride than shortboards, making them a popular choice for beginners and people who want to enjoy the sport in a more relaxed and leisurely way. </p>

            <p>
                Funboard surfboards, also known as mini-mals or fish surfboards, are surfboards that are typically smaller and more maneuverable than longboards but bigger and more stable than shortboards. They are designed to be a "happy medium" between longboards and shortboards, providing a balance of stability and performance. </p>

                Short surfboards, also known as shortboards, are surfboards that are typically smaller and more maneuverable than longboards or funboards. They are designed for experienced surfers who want to perform tricks and maneuvers, catch bigger and more powerful waves, and ride at high speeds. </p>
