          <h2>Kite surfing</h2>
           
          <p>Kitesurfing, also known as kiteboarding, is a sport that combines elements of windsurfing, paragliding, and wakeboarding. It involves standing on a board, similar to a wakeboard or surfboard, and using a kite, that is attached to the rider by a harness, to harness the power of the wind to propel oneself across the water.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Kitesurfing can be learned by anyone who is physically fit and has a basic understanding of wind and water conditions. However, it is generally recommended that individuals are at least 14 years of age and have some experience with other water sports, such as surfing or windsurfing. It is also recommended that individuals are comfortable in the water,
             have good swimming skills and can handle the physical demands of the sport.</p>
