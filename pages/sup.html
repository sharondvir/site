          <h2>SUP surfing</h2>
          <p>Stand-up paddle surfing, also known as SUP surfing, is a variant of surfing in which individuals stand on a large, stable board and use a paddle to navigate and ride the waves. It is a relatively new sport and has grown in popularity in recent years.

            Anyone can learn to SUP surf, as it is a relatively easy and accessible sport. It is a great way for people who may not have the strength or skill to traditional surf to still enjoy the ocean and the waves. It also provides a full-body workout, as it requires the use of core and upper body muscles to maintain balance and propel the board.
